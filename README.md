# Docker Shared Services

This repository provides a Docker-powered local development environment for Dockerized projects, compatible with macOS and Linux.

It includes a set of docker-compose files and [Tr√¶fik](https://traefik.io/) configuration with SSL support, backed by [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert), to enable running a local network with custom DNS provided by [dnsmasq](https://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html). This setup facilitates developing microservices locally with access outside the Docker network.

<br>

## ü§î Purpose

### ‚Üí Simplifying Local Development

This project simplifies local development by addressing common issues such as:

- Frequent updates to the `/etc/hosts` file.
- Requirement of administrative access for changes.
- Lack of SSL support for custom domains.
- Port conflicts when forwarding Docker service ports to the host machine.
- Use of cumbersome hostnames like `localhost:8800` for local projects.
- Complex CORS setup and Cookie configuration.

For Linux and macOS users, dnsmasq eliminates the need to edit the hosts file for each project, providing a streamlined solution when used with Traefik, mkcert, and Docker. This repository configures Traefik to work with dnsmasq, offering a system-wide DNS solution for microservices and enabling DNS and SSL features with local domains.

<br>

<br>

## üíª Quick Start Guide (macOS)

1. **Install Homebrew** (if not installed):

   If [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is not already installed, run the following command:

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **Install Docker** (if not installed):

   Set up Docker Desktop via Homebrew:

      ```bash
      brew install --cask docker
      ```

3. **Install `mkcert` and `nss`:**

   `mkcert` is a tool that creates locally-trusted development certificates, and `nss` provides support for mkcert certificates in Firefox.

   ```bash
   brew install mkcert nss
   ```

4. **Create shared project directory:**

   This repository should be run once per machine, so let's create a shared directory for this project:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/projects/infra && cd ~/projects/infra
   ```

5. **Clone this repository:**

      ```bash
      git clone \
        git@github.com:wayofdev/docker-shared-services.git \
        ~/projects/infra/docker-shared-services && \
      cd ~/projects/infra/docker-shared-services
      ```

6. **Create `.env` file:**

   Generate a default `.env` file, which contains configuration settings for the project.

   ```bash
   make env
   ```

   Open this file and read the notes inside to make any necessary changes to fit your setup.

7. **Install root certificate** and generate default project certs:

   This step installs the root certificate into your system's trust store and generates default SSL certificates for your local domains, which are listed in the `.env` file, under the variable `TLS_DOMAINS`.

   ```bash
   make cert-install
   ```

      > [!Note]
      >
      > Currently, on macOS, you may need to enter your password several times to allow `mkcert` to install the root certificate.
      > **This is a one-time operation** and details can be found in this upstream GitHub [issue](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/issues/415).

8. **Run this project:**

   Start the Docker services defined in the repository.

   ```bash
   make up
   ```

9. **Check that all Docker services are running:**

   Ensure Docker is running and services are up by using the `make ps` and `make logs` commands.

   ```bash
   make ps
   make logs
   ```

10. **Add custom DNS resolver to your system:**

    This allows macOS to understand that `*.docker` domains should be resolved by a custom resolver via `127.0.0.1`, where our DNSMasq, which runs inside Docker, will handle all DNS requests.

    ```bash
    sudo sh -c 'echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" > /etc/resolver/docker'
    sudo dscacheutil -flushcache
    sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
    ```

    You can check that DNS was added by running:

    ```bash
    scutil --dns
    ```

    Example output:

    ```bash
    resolver #8
    domain   : docker
    nameserver[0] : 127.0.0.1
    flags    : Request A records, Request AAAA records
    reach    : 0x00030002 (Reachable,Local Address,Directly Reachable Address)
    ```

    > [!Note]
    >
    > Instead of creating the `/etc/resolver/docker` file, you can add `127.0.0.1` to your macOS DNS Servers in your Ethernet or Wi-Fi settings.
    >
    > Go to **System Preferences ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Wi-Fi ‚Üí Details ‚Üí DNS** and add `127.0.0.1` as the first DNS server.
    >
    > This allows you to do it one time, and if you need to create a new local domain, for example `*.mac`, in the future, it will be automatically resolved without creating a separate `/etc/resolver/mac` file.

11. **Ping `router.docker` to check if DNS is working:**

    Ensure that the DNS setup is functioning correctly.

    ```bash
    ping router.docker -c 3
    ping any-domain.docker -c 3
    ```

12. **Access Traefik dashboard:**

    Open [https://router.docker](https://router.docker).

    You should see the Traefik Dashboard:

    ![Traefik dashboard](.github/assets/traefik.png?raw=true "Traefik dashboard example")

### ‚Üí Outcome

At this point, you should have a working local development environment with DNS and SSL support ready to be used with your projects.

Services will be running under a shared Docker network called `network.ss`, and all projects or microservices that will share the same [Docker network](https://docs.docker.com/network/) will be visible to Traefik. The local DNS, served by DNSMasq, will be available on `*.docker` domains.

## üêß Quick Start Guide (Linux)

In this section, we'll walk through setting up the `docker-shared-services` project on an Ubuntu distribution. While the steps are specific to Ubuntu, they should be adaptable to other Linux distributions with minor modifications.

1. **Install Docker:**
   Easiest and quickest way to get started is to [install Docker Desktop for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/#generic-installation-steps).

   - [Install Docker Desktop on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/ubuntu/)

2. **Install `certutil`:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install libnss3-tools
   ```

3. **Install `mkcert`:**

   ```bash
   curl -JLO "https://dl.filippo.io/mkcert/latest?for=linux/amd64"
   chmod +x mkcert-v*-linux-amd64
   sudo cp mkcert-v*-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/mkcert
   ```

   More detailed instructions can be found in the [`mkcert README.md`](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert?tab=readme-ov-file#linux).

4. **Create shared project directory:**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/projects/infra && cd ~/projects/infra
   ```

5. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone \
     git@github.com:wayofdev/docker-shared-services.git \
     ~/projects/infra/docker-shared-services && \
   cd ~/projects/infra/docker-shared-services
   ```

6. **Create `.env` file:**

   Generate a default `.env` file, which contains configuration settings for the project.

   ```bash
   make env
   ```

   Open this file and read the notes inside to make any necessary changes to fit your setup.

7. **Install root certificate** and generate default project certs:

   ```bash
   make cert-install
   ```

8. **Disable stub DNS listener:**

   To prevent conflicts with the DNSMasq service, disable the stub DNS listener in the `systemd-resolved` service.

   ```bash
   sudo sed -i 's/#DNSStubListener=yes/DNSStubListener=no/' /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
   sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
   ```

9. **Edit /etc/resolv.conf:**

   Update the `/etc/resolv.conf` file to use the local DNS server.

   ```bash
   echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf > /dev/null
   ```

   Editing `/etc/resolv.conf` directly is not recommended for persistent changes since it is often managed by other services (like Netplan or NetworkManager). However, for a temporary change, you can use:

10. **Run this project:**

    Start the Docker services defined in the repository.

    ```bash
    make up
    ```

11. **Check that all Docker services are running:**

    Ensure Docker is running and services are up by using the `make ps` and `make logs` commands.

    ```bash
    make ps
    make logs
    ```

12. **Ping `router.docker` to check if DNS is working:**

    Ensure that the DNS setup is functioning correctly.

    ```bash
    ping router.docker -c 3
    ping any-domain.docker -c 3
    ```

13. **Access Traefik dashboard:**

    Open [https://router.docker](https://router.docker).

    You should see the Traefik Dashboard:

    ![Traefik dashboard](.github/assets/traefik.png?raw=true "Traefik dashboard example")

### ‚Üí Outcome

At this point, you should have a working local development environment with DNS and SSL support ready to be used with your projects.

Services will be running under a shared Docker network called `network.ss`, and all projects or microservices that will share the same [Docker network](https://docs.docker.com/network/) will be visible to Traefik. The local DNS, served by DNSMasq, will be available on `*.docker` domains.

## üîå Connecting your Projects to Shared Services

To connect your projects to the shared services, configure your project's `docker-compose.yaml` file to connect to the shared network and Traefik.

This project comes with an example Portainer service, which also starts by default with the `make up` command. You can check the [`docker-compose.yaml`](https://github.com/wayofdev/docker-shared-services/blob/master/docker-compose.yaml) to see how Traefik labels and the shared network are used to spin up Portainer on the <https://ui.docker> host, which supports SSL by default.

### ‚Üí Sample Configuration

Your project should use the shared Docker network `network.ss` and Traefik labels to expose services to the outside world.

1. **Change your project's `docker-compose.yaml` file:**

      ```diff
      ---

      services:
        web:
          image: wayofdev/nginx:k8s-alpine-latest
          restart: on-failure
      +   networks:
      +     - default
      +     - shared
          volumes:
            - ./app:/app:rw,cached
      +   labels:
      +     - traefik.enable=true
      +     - traefik.http.routers.api-my-project-secure.rule=Host(`api.my-project.docker`)
      +     - traefik.http.routers.api-my-project-secure.entrypoints=websecure
      +     - traefik.http.routers.api-my-project-secure.tls=true
      +     - traefik.http.services.api-my-project-secure.loadbalancer.server.port=8880
      +     - traefik.docker.network=network.ss

      networks:
      + shared:
      +   external: true
      +   name: network.ss
      + default:
      +   name: project.my-project
      ```

   In this configuration, we added the shared network and Traefik labels to the web service. These labels help Traefik route the traffic to the service based on the specified rules.

   Replace `my-project` with your preferred project name.

2. **Generate SSL certs for your project:**

   Go to the `docker-shared-services` directory:

   ```bash
   cd ~/projects/infra/docker-shared-services
   ```

   Edit the `.env` file to add your custom domain:

   ```bash
   nano .env
   ```

   Add `*.my-project.docker` to end of `TLS_DOMAINS` variable:

   ```bash
   TLS_DOMAINS="ui.docker router.docker *.my-project.docker"
   ```

   Generate SSL certificates and reload `docker-shared-services`:

   ```bash
   make cert-install restart
   ```

<br>

## üöÄ Example: Spin-up Laravel Sail Project

Let's walk through an example of setting up a Laravel project using Sail and integrating it with the `docker-shared-services`.

1. Create an example Laravel project based on Sail:

   ```bash
   curl -s "https://laravel.build/example-app" | bash
   ```

2. Open the `docker-compose.yaml` file of the `example-app` project and make adjustments:

   ```diff
   services:
     laravel.test:
       build:
         context: ./vendor/laravel/sail/runtimes/8.3
         dockerfile: Dockerfile
         args:
           WWWGROUP: '${WWWGROUP}'
       image: sail-8.3/app
   -   extra_hosts:
   -     - 'host.docker.internal:host-gateway'
       ports:
   -     - '${APP_PORT:-80}:80'
   -     - '${VITE_PORT:-5173}:${VITE_PORT:-5173}'
       networks:
         - sail
   +     - shared
       depends_on:
         - ...
   +   labels:
   +     - traefik.enable=true
   +     - traefik.http.routers.test-laravel-app-secure.rule=Host(`api.laravel-app.docker`)
   +     - traefik.http.routers.test-laravel-app-secure.entrypoints=websecure
   +     - traefik.http.routers.test-laravel-app-secure.tls=true
   +     - traefik.http.services.test-laravel-app-secure.loadbalancer.server.port=80
   +     - traefik.docker.network=network.ss

     mailpit:
       image: 'axllent/mailpit:latest'
       networks:
         - sail
   +     - shared
       ports:
   -     - '${FORWARD_MAILPIT_PORT:-1025}:1025'
   -     - '${FORWARD_MAILPIT_DASHBOARD_PORT:-8025}:8025'
   +   labels:
   +     - traefik.enable=true
   +     - traefik.http.routers.mail-laravel-app-secure.rule=Host(`mail.laravel-app.docker`)
   +     - traefik.http.routers.mail-laravel-app-secure.entrypoints=websecure
   +     - traefik.http.routers.mail-laravel-app-secure.tls=true
   +     - traefik.http.services.mail-laravel-app-secure.loadbalancer.server.port=8025
   +     - traefik.docker.network=network.ss

   networks:
     sail:
       driver: bridge
   + shared:
   +   external: true
   +   name: network.ss
   ```

   These changes connect the Laravel app and Mailpit docker services to the shared network and expose them via Traefik.

3. **Run the Laravel project:**

   Navigate to the `example-app` directory and start the services using Sail.

   ```bash
   ./vendor/bin/sail up -d
   ```

4. **Check Traefik routers**:

   Open <https://router.docker/dashboard/#/http/routers> and check that there are two routers:

   - `Host(api.laravel-app.docker)`  ‚Üí `test-laravel-app-secure@docker`
   - `Host(mail.laravel-app.docker)` ‚Üí `mail-laravel-app-secure@docker`

   ![Traefik Routers](.github/assets/traefik-routers.png?raw=true "Traefik Routers Example")

5. **Check the setup**:

   Ensure that your Laravel application and Mailpit services are running correctly by accessing their respective domains:

   - **Laravel app** ‚Äî [https://api.laravel-app.docker](https://api.laravel-app.docker/)
   - **Mailpit** ‚Äî [https://mail.laravel-app.docker](https://mail.laravel-app.docker/)

At this point, your Laravel project is integrated with the `wayofdev/docker-shared-services`, utilizing DNS and SSL support for local development.
